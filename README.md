# cse412_backend
backend for the CSE 412 project.

## Development
Install [nix](https://zero-to-nix.com/start/install) for the least pain, and run `nix develop` to get a development environment.

Otherwise, just install python and the right dependencies. This is a setuptools compliant package.

## Running
Either do `nix run`, or `python3 -m cse412_backend` once you have a suitable development environment.
